               <p>Interest rate derivatives are typically priced (a.k.a. “valued”)
                                by forecasting the future price and price evolution of the assets
                                that underlie the derivative, using these forecasts to estimate the
                                future cash flows of the derivative instrument, and then discounting
                                these cash flows to the preset.</p>
                        
               <p>For example, interest rate swap cash flows are typically
                                calculated based in part on an floating interest rate index (such as
                                US Dollar 3 month LIBOR). An interest rate swap’s value is usually
                                estimated by forecasting the floating rate (in this example,
                                USD-LIBOR-3M), calculating the forecast cash flows, and then
                                discounting them to the present using a discount curve.</p>
                        
               <p>More complex products such as option products frequently use a
                                similar process, but price the instrument under a variety of
                                forecasts and estimate the value of the derivative by averaging or
                                otherwise combining the various forecasts.</p>
                        
               <p>This specification describes ways to represent the data that is
                                needed for generating these forecasts, if required for valuation
                                reporting.</p>

                                        etc.), </li>

               <p>The QueryPortfolio type allows a portfolio to be created by

                                are defined by one or more elements of type QueryParameter. A
                                QueryParameter contains a triplet consisting of elements of type
                                QueryParamterId, QueryParameterValue, and QueryParameterOperator. A
                                queryParameterId element will state a specific criteria such as
                                product, or payment date, from a list defined by attribute
                                queryParameterIdScheme. The queryParameterValue for that stated
                                queryParameterId will provide a value for comparison such as swap,
                                or 20040923, and the queryParameterOperator will define the nature
                                of the comparison such as equals, or greater than, from a list
                                defined by attribute queryParameterOperatorScheme. </p>

               <p>For sensitivities, either the name or the definitionRef attribute
                                (or both) must be filled in. It is not easy to enforce this
                                requirement in the schema.</p>

               <p>Where there are two ways to traverse references upward through
                                parallel structures, the resulting destination must be the same. For
                                example, assume that a Sensitivity has a definitionRef to a
                                SensitivityDefinition. This is contained within a
                                SensitivitySetDefinition. If the SensitivitySet that contains the
                                Sensitivity also has a definitionReference, it must be the same
                                SensitivitySetDefinition as before. Following is an illustration:</p>

               <p>Similarly, there will normally be consistency between valuation
                                scenario references in sensitivity definitions and those in
                                sensitivity set definitions, if they are present in
                        both.</p>

                                        traded between two counterparties. When it comes to
                                        Valuation, there is a need for abstract deals, representing
                                        typically what the Broker market is quoting. The question is
                                        how to represent these “abstract deals”. </p>

                                                can be done in two different ways: <ul class="bulleted">

                                                  rely on market convention. At the
                                                  extreme, these could be only names,
                                                  e.g. SWAPUSD-10Y. The advantage is
                                                  that the task can be carried out
                                                  relatively fast, counting on the
                                                  fact that the number of abstract
                                                  deals needed is small. The
                                                  disadvantage is that relying on
                                                  market conventions, can potentially
                                                  lead to a disagreement between two

                                                  means the PRWG could potentially
                                                  have to redo a large part of what

                  <p>In FpML, the stub is defined in terms of dates
                                        (FirstRegularPeriodStartDate...). Since in abstract deals
                                        this is not possible we must define the stubs a priori.
                                        There are implicit market conventions for these but they are
                                        rather loosely defined. A stub can be placed:</p>
                                
                  <ul class="bulleted">

                  <p>The term of a stub can be:</p>
                                
                  <ul class="bulleted">
                                        
                     <li>short, which means shorter than the regular period</li>

                  <p>It is always possible to create a short stub from a long
                                        one by creating an extra-regular period. The reciprocal is
                                        true, by aggregating the short period to the next or
                                        previous regular period. </p>
                                
                  <p>The market convention tends to refuse to have a stub that
                                        is “too” short (say 10 days). </p>
                                
                  <p>The only reason why you would have a stub at the
                                        beginning and at the end is because the Roll Convention is
                                        not on the start or termination date. </p>
