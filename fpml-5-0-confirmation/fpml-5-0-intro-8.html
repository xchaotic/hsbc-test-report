            <p>In FpML version 3.0 the equityOption component was defined to describe "vanilla" options with the following characteristics:</p>
		
            <ul class="bulleted">
			
               <li>put and call options;</li>
			
               <li>with American or European exercise styles;</li>
			
               <li>on single stocks or indices; and</li>
			
               <li>delivery being either cash or physical stock.</li>
		
            </ul>
		
            <p>FpML 4.0 extended this component to encompass more exotic types of options, including:</p>
		
            <ul class="bulleted">
			
               <li>Bermudan exercise style;</li>
			
               <li>basket underlyings;</li>
			
               <li>forward starts;</li>
			
               <li>quantos and composites;</li>
			
               <li>averaging; and</li>
			
               <li>barriers, knock-ins, knock-outs and binary (digital) options.</li>
		
            </ul>
		
            <p> FpML 4.1 introduced additional components for both "short form" transacation supplement and broker equity option representations, and a "long form" Equity Forward. All long and short form instances are derived by extension from long and short form base types:</p>
		
            <ul class="bulleted">
			
               <li>brokerEquityOption</li>
			
               <li> equityForward</li>
			
               <li>equityOption</li>
			
               <li>equityOptionTransactionSupplement</li>
		
            </ul>
		
            <p>
			
               <a href="images/equity-options/ClassHierarchy.gif">
                  <img src="images/equity-options/ClassHierarchy.gif" alt="images/equity-options/ClassHierarchy.gif" class="image" width="600"/>
               </a>
		
            </p>
		
            <p>these components provide support for:</p>
		
            <ul class="bulleted">
			
               <li>Broker Equity Options;</li>
			
               <li>Long Form Equity Forwards;</li>
			
               <li>Long Form Equity Options;</li>
			
               <li>Short Form Equity Options represented as Transaction Supplements under ISDA Master Agreements.</li>
		
            </ul>
		
            <p>Many of the above can be combined through the use of a single component architecture that has a number of optional features. Compound options (such as Butterfly and Straddle structures) can be represented by combining two or more <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eqd-5-0.xsd.html_element_equityOption.html">equityOption</a> components in a <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-doc-5-0.xsd.html_element_strategy.html">strategy</a> component. Simple strike or calendar spread strategies can be represented using the Strategy Feature component.</p>
		
            <p>Through a combination of derivation by extension, and composing the available features, the vast majority of equity option structures that are used between wholesale market counterparties can be represented in FpML.</p>
		
            <p>The product architecture draws directly on ISDA's 1996 and 2002 definitions for equity derivatives. Wherever possible the terminology and practice of the ISDA definitions has been adopted to ensure consistency between traditional and FpML contract representations.</p>

               <p> FpML supports three styles of equity option: European, American and Bermudan. For consistency of representation with interest rate derivatives each of these styles is represented using its own component. Each of these components is described more fully below. The <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eqd-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityEuropeanExercise.html">automaticExercise</a> element contains a boolean value. If true then each option not previously exercised will be deemed to be exercised at the expiration time on the expiration date without service of notice unless the buyer notifies the seller that it no longer wishes this to occur.</p>
			
               <p> The <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eqd-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityExerciseValuationSettlement.html">EquityValuation</a> component specifies the date and time on which the option is valued. The element <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eq-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityValuation.html">valuationDate</a> is assumed to have the meaning as defined in the ISDA 2002 Equity Derivatives Definitions. It enables the <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eq-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_AdjustableDateOrRelativeDateSequence.html">valuationDate</a> to be expressed in relation to some other date defined in the document (the anchor date), where there is the opportunity to specify a combination of offset rules. This component will typically be used for defining the valuation date in relation to the payment date, as both the currency and the exchange holiday calendars need to be considered. Alternatively, <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eq-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_AdjustableDateOrRelativeDateSequence.html">valuationDate</a> is a date that shall be subject to adjustment if it would otherwise fall on a day that is not a business day in the specified business centers, together with the convention for adjusting the date. The element <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eq-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityValuation.html">valuationDates</a> specifies the interim equity valuation dates of the swap. The <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_AdjustableRelativeOrPeriodicDates.html">valuationDates</a> can be specified as a series of dates that shall be subject to adjustment if they would otherwise fall on a day that is not a business day in the specified business centers, together with the convention for adjusting the date, otherwise, the <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_AdjustableRelativeOrPeriodicDates.html">valuationDates</a> is a series of dates specified as some offset to other dates (the anchor dates). The element <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eq-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityValuation.html">valuationTimeType</a> is the time of day at which the calculation agent values the underlying, for example the official closing time of the exchange. The element <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eq-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityValuation.html">valuationTime</a> specifies the time of day at which the calculation agent values the underlying. The <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eq-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityValuation.html">futuresPriceValuation</a> element contains a boolean value to indicate whether or not the official settlement price as announced by the related exchange is applicable, in accordance with the ISDA 2002 definitions. The <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eq-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityValuation.html">optionsPriceValuation</a> element contains a boolean value to indicate whether or not the the official settlement price as announced by the related exchange is applicable, in accordance with the ISDA 2002 definitions..</p>
			
               <p>The <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eqd-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityExerciseValuationSettlement.html">EquitySettlement</a> component specifies equity option contractural settlement information. The settlement date specifies when the option is to be settled relative to the valuation date. If the settlement date is not specified explicitly then settlement will take place on the valuation date. The settlementType component is used to specify whether the option is settled in cash or physically.</p>
			
               <p>The <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eqd-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityExerciseValuationSettlement.html">settlementPriceSource</a> element specifies the source from which the settlement price is to be obtained, e.g. a Reuters page, Prezzo di Riferimento, etc.</p>

                  <p> An asian option is one in which an average price is used to derive the strike price ("averaging in") or the expiration price ("averaging out") or both. The type of averaging is specified in the <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-option-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_Asian.html">averagingInOut</a> element.</p>
				
                  <p>The period over which the averaging is calculated is specified in the component <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-option-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_Asian.html">averagingPeriodIn</a> or <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-option-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_Asian.html">averagingPeriodOut</a> as appropriate. Both components have the same structure. The period is specified either as a calculation, using one or more <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-option-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_AveragingPeriod.html">schedule</a> components (which permits specifications such as every Friday from and including 24 May 2002 to and including 22 November 2002), and/or as a list of explicit dates and times, using the <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-option-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_AveragingPeriod.html">averagingDateTimes</a> component.

In the event that any of the dates is not a business day then it is assumed that it will be rolled forward to the next business day in accordance with ISDA convention. The <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-option-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_AveragingPeriod.html">marketDisruption</a> element specifies the action to be taken if it is not possible to obtain a price on one of the days used for averaging.</p>

               <p>In FpML the premium amount can be expressed in a number of ways: as a monetary amount (<a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eq-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityPremium.html">paymentAmount</a>), as a price per option (<a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eq-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityPremium.html">pricePerOption</a>) or as a percentage of notional (<a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-eq-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_EquityPremium.html">percentageOfNotional</a>) - if more than one method is used then they must be mutually consistent.

               </h4>
			
               <p>When a date specified in an equity option contract falls on a non-business day then it may be necessary to adjust it to be a business day. At the time the contract is agreed it is not always possible to determine whether or not a particular date in the future will be a business day.</p>
			
               <p>The meaning of "business day" varies according to the context in which it is used. When the context is the payments of monetary amounts then the rules for adjustment according to currency business days apply, and the equity option product architecture uses the same <a class="web" href="schemaRef/fpml-shared-5-0.xsd.html_type_AdjustableOrRelativeDate.html">AdjustableOrRelativeDate</a> component ( or derivations ) as the interest rate and foreign exchange products.</p>
			
               <p>However, when the context is the valuation or settlement of equities or equity indices then the term "business day" means "exchange business day". In this case the equity option product architecture specifies the use of unadjusted dates with the adjustment rules being implicitly inherited from the ISDA definitions.</p>
